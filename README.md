Blog
====

Simple blog written in go.

Mostly to get used to the language.  It'll be used as my personal blog when it's done.
It uses D3 for the navigation path.  Right now it's just a simple RESTful setup, but eventually will have caching and other features.  

The only package outside the stdlib that is used is the postgres driver.  To get a real feel for the language, I'm forcing myself to roll each piece personally.
